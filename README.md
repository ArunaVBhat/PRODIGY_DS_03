# PRODIGY_DS_03
This project implements a decision tree classifier using Python's scikit-learn library. The classifier is trained to predict outcomes based on labeled datasets, making it a powerful tool for both classification and regression tasks. The decision tree model is easy to visualize and interpret, helping to understand the decision-making process behind predictions.

To run the project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib). After loading and preparing your dataset, you can train the decision tree model, visualize the tree, and evaluate its performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
